Emergency Response Simulator   
Description  
This C# console application simulates emergency response units (Police, Firefighters, Ambulance) responding to incidents in a city using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  

 How to Run  
 1 Clone the repository using:  
2.	 Open the project in **Visual Studio** or run via the **command line**.  
3.	 Compile and execute `Program.cs`.  
4.	
 OOP Concepts Applied  
5.	Abstraction** (EmergencyUnit base class)  
6.	Inheritance** (Police, Firefighter, Ambulance classes)  
7.	Polymorphism** (Overriding methods)  
8.	Encapsulation** (Private properties)  

9.	 File Structure  
10.	Program.cs` → Contains the main simulation loop.  
11.	EmergencyUnit.cs` → Abstract class for all emergency units.  
12.	Police.cs`, `Firefighter.cs`, `Ambulance.cs` → Subclasses implementing unit-specific behavior.  
13.	ncident.cs` → Stores incident type & location.
